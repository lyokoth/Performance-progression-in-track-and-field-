Project Description
This project aims to analyze the progression of sprinting times over the years, specifically focusing on the Outdoor 100 Meter Dash for men.  By extracting data from a specific webpage, the project creates a dataframe to enable detailed analysis and visualization of the collected sprinting records.

Features
Web scraping: Utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from a webpage containing sprinting records.
Data extraction: Extracts relevant information such as rank, mark (time), wind, name, and nationality of the sprinters.
DataFrame creation: Organizes the extracted data into a structured dataframe for further analysis.
Progression analysis: Performs exploratory data analysis to analyze how sprinting times have improved over the years.
Visualization: Provides data visualization capabilities to better understand the trends and patterns in sprinting performance.
Future Enhancements
Historical analysis: Extend the analysis to cover multiple years or historical data to observe long-term trends in sprinting times.
Statistical analysis: Conduct statistical tests and calculations to identify significant improvements and assess the significance of various factors influencing sprinting performance.
Comparative analysis: Compare the performance of different countries, athletes, or age groups to identify patterns and outliers.
Interactive dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard or web application to allow users to explore the data and visualize the progression of sprinting times.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
BeautifulSoup: Library for web scraping and HTML parsing.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, including dataframe creation.
Matplotlib / Plotly: Libraries for data visualization and creating meaningful plots and charts.
GitHub: Version control repository for collaborative development and project management.

TODO: Add more sprinting events, like men's 200, and 400M dashes, as well as women's 100, 200, and 400M.
